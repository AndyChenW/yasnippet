* Changes
** Changes for 0.9.0
*** New features
**** =yas-key-syntaxes= is much more powerful and accepts functions
     Enables use cases when discovering keys based on buffer syntax is
     not good enough. See issue #497.
**** Documentation rewritten in org-mode and updated
     A tremendous effort by Noam Postavsky. Hopefully easier to
     maintain and navigate. Available at
     http://capitaomorte.github.io/yasnippet/.
**** Snippets are now maintained in their own repo
     Snippets live in Andrea Crotti's
     =https://github.com/andreacrotti/yasnippet-snippets=. See
     README.md for more details.
**** Textmate snippet imported moved to separate =yasmate= repo
     URL is =https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasmate=. See README.md
     for more details.
**** =yas-snippet-dirs= now allows symbols as aliases to directories
     The added level of indirection should allow more esoteric
     configurations. See Github #495.
**** =yas-reload-all= can now jit-load when called interactively
**** Tests run automatically in the Travis CI system
**** New =yas-after-reload-hook= run after =yas-reload-all=
     See https://github.com/pezra/rspec-mode/pull/75 for the
     discussion leading up to this change.
**** New functions =yas-activate-extra-mode= and =yas-deactivate-extra-mode=
     These are preferable to setting =yas-extra-modes= directly in the
     mode hook. See issue #420 for more information.
**** New snippet-mode command =yas-load-snippet-buffer-and-close=
     Bound to =C-c C-c= by default. =yas-load-snippet-buffer='s
     binding is now =C-c C-l= and it no longer closes the snippet
     window. See issues #417, #432.
**** New variable =yas-new-snippet-default=
     The default snippet suggested on =yas-new-snippet= can now be
     customized.
**** No longer bundle dropdown-list.el.
     See issues #356, #370.
**** yasnippet key bindings are now controlled via =yas-minor-mode-map=
     instead of =yas-trigger-key= which is removed. See issue #296.
**** New Function =yas-active-keys= returns currently active snippet keys.
     See issues #277, #315.

     mechanisms.

** Changes for 0.8.0
*** New features
**** All YASnippet symbols being with =yas-=. Keep old =yas/= versions as aliases
**** Yasnippet is now Free Software Foundation's copyright
**** =yas-dont-activate= can be a list of functions
**** Snippets are loaded just-in-time 
     Thanks to Matthew Fidler for a lot of input with the implementation.
**** =yasnippet-bundle.el= is no longer available
     Use =yas-compile-directory= instead if you need the speed advantage.
**** New functions =yas-compile-directory= and  =yas-recompile-all=
     This feature is still undocumented.  Generate a
     =.yas-compiled-snippets.el= file in the directory passed where
     snippets are compiled into emacs-lisp code.
**** New =yas-verbosity= variable
**** Interactively calling =yas-exit-snippet= exist most recently inserted snippet
**** Using filenames as snippet triggers is deprecated
**** Default value of =yas-show-menu-p= is =abbreviate=
**** =yas-visit-snippet= ignores =yas-prompt-functions=
**** =yas-buffer-local-condition=  restricted to trigger-key expansions by default
**** =yas-load-snippet-buffer= (=C-c C-c=) in =snippet-mode= has been much improved
**** New variable =yas-expand-only-for-last-commands=, thanks Erik Postma
**** New variable =yas-extra-modes= aliases old =yas/mode-symbol=
**** New =yas-describe-tables= command
**** New =yas-define-condition-cache= macro
     This defines an optimised function for placing in a =#
     condition:= directive that will run at most once per
     snippet-expansion attempt.
**** Mirrors can occur inside fields
**** New =# type: command= directive
     This feature is still undocumented
**** A hidden =.yas-setup.el= is loaded if found in a snippet directory
**** =yas/wrap-around-region= can now also be =cua= (undocumented feature)
**** Make menu groups automatically using new  =.yas-make-groups= file
**** Per-snippet keybindings using =# keybinding:= directive
**** More friendly =yas/expand-snippet= calling convention
     This breaks backward compatibility.
**** The =# env:= directive is now =# expand-env:=
**** Setup multiple parent modes using new =.yas-parents= file
*** Fixed bugs
    TODO: harvest most "Fix XXX" references from the comments and add
    each as a single heading. A googlecode tracker bug should be "Fix
    Googlecode 123" whereas a github tracker bug should be "Fix Github
    #123". If a summarized description can be done in a few words, add
    it, otherwise don't care.
